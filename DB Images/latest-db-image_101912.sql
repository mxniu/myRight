Most car accidents are the result of a driver''s negligence. Therefore, when people sue a driver in court for damages caused by a car accident, they are really suing because the driver was negligent. There are four conditions that must be proved to show that someone was "negligent."</p>\n<b>1. Duty</b>. In certain situations, people have a duty of care. For example, a restaurant has a duty not to serve rotting food; a security guard has a duty to keep watch; and a driver has a duty to drive safely. Although we rarely think of these examples as a person''s "duty," this is how the law defines it for negligence.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>2. Breach</b>. The person must "breach" or break their duty. The standard for deciding whether the person breached their duty is the reasonable person standard. All this really means is, did the person act in a way that most other people would have in the situation? If the answer is no, the person has breached their duty. For example, texting while driving is a breach of the duty to drive safely, and most drivers would not text while driving.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>3. Cause</b>. The breach of duty must have caused harm or damage. You can''t sue someone if it really wasn''t their fault. For example, a restaurant might breach its duty by serving you bad food. You could probably sue the restaurant for getting sick. But you couldn''t sue it for breaking your arm while skiing a week later. This is because your broken arm was not caused by the restaurant''s breach of duty.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>4. Harm</b>. Lastly, the harm must be actual damages that can be compensated. Usually physical or property damage count because your medical and repair bills can be compensated. You may also be able to recover for pain and suffering caused by the physical harm. It is more difficult, though not impossible, to recover damages for emotional damages.

You go to a hospital and find out you have fractured ribs caused by a car accident. Since there is no real treatment for fractured ribs but time, you only have a medical bill for the x-rays, which is about $600. It takes four to six weeks for fractured ribs to heal and in that time you experience a great deal of pain because every time you breathe in, pressure is put on your ribs.

You receive a face injury from a car accident, which leaves a giant scar extending from your cheek to your forehead. The disfigurement is unpleasant and causes you a great deal of social anxiety.

In additional to physical pain, there is emotional distress such as anxiety, depression, embarrassment, and interference with work and hobbies. Although pain and suffering is subjective, there are a couple methods used to calculate it.</p>\n<b>Multiplier</b>. One common method used to calculate pain and suffering is to multiply you known economic damages, such as your medical bills and lost wages, by a multiplier. Usually the multiplier will be a number between 1.5 and 4, depending on a variety of factors including the seriousness of your injuries, length of recovery, the presence of permanent injuries, and any aggravating circumstances. <b>For example</b>, if your medical bills were $2000 and your lost wages were $1000 because you missed a week of work, then your total economic damages were $3000. This number is then multiplied to determine your pain and suffering. You could potentially recover up to $12,000 (multiplied by 4) or more, if your injuries were severe. \n<br/><br/>\n<b>Per Diem</b>. Another method used is to assign a “per day” value to your pain and suffering. Multiply the per-day value by how many days it took for you to recover or complete treatment. One way to come up with a per-day value is to use your actual income. <b>For example</b>, if you are paid $120 per day for your job and were in treatment for 30 days, your pain and suffering equals $3600 according to this method.

(567, 'secondary', '', 10, '<p>Lost wages include the loss of present earnings and future lost income. In order to recover money for these loses, they must be caused by the car accident injury. Here are some examples of lost wages that can be compensated.</p>\n<b>Missed days</b>. Missing some days of work due to a car accident is the most common type of lost wages that can be claim. For example, if you usually get paid $1000 a week and you missed 2 weeks of work because you were recovering in the hospital, you can claim $2000 in lost wages. \n<br/><br/> \n<b>Hours reduced</b>. Reduced hours due to an injury may be claimed as future lost income. For example, you usually work 40 hours a week, but since the accident you can only work 20 hours because of your injuries. You may be able to claim the lost 20 hours per week of work as lost future earnings. \n<br/><br/> \n<b>Denied promotion</b>. A denied promotion may be claimed as future lost income. If you were expecting a promotion, but were denied because your injuries made you inadequate for the position, then you might be able to claim the different between the position’s salary and your current salary. For example, if you were denied a promotion to head chef for a salary of $62,000, and your current salary is $50,000, you might be able to claim $12,000 a year. However, it may be difficult to prove that the car accident caused your promotion denial. \n<br/><br/>\n<b>Unable to take a job</b>. The inability to take a new job may be claimed as future lost income. However, similar to a denied promotion, you must be able to show a connection between the car accident and the loss of the new job. IF the causation is too far removed, you won’t be able to claim this. \n<br/><br/>\n<b>Hindered training or education</b>. Injuries from a car accident might reduce overall your future earning potential. For example, the inability to start a training or education program may be claimed as future lost income because usually such training or education is for the purpose of obtaining a job. You might be able to claim the accident caused you to miss out on some education program, which in turn caused you to loss a good job.
