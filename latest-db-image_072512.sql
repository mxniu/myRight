The officer can use other senses such as sound and smell, in addition to sight, to make sure you have not drank, regurgitated, burped, vomited, eaten, or smoked during the 15 minute period. An officer might be a few feet from you, writing things down and occasionally looking up to satisfy this requirement. Or an officer might be in the front seat of a car driving you to the station. If an officer is in another room, completely out of sight and listening range, he is probably not observing you.', 'Under California Code of Regulations, Title 17 Â§ 1219.3, a person can only be breath tested after being under continuous observation for at least 15 minutes. This must be done in order to ensure that the person does not drink, regurgitate, burp, vomit, eat, or smoke, before the breathalyzer. These actions might introduce tiny amounts of alcohol in a personâ€™s mouth, which might result in an inaccurate BAC reading because the machine assumes it is only measuring a personâ€™s breath, and not any mouth alcohol. Any alcohol in a personâ€™s mouth, even very tiny amount, can result in a higher and incorrect BAC measurement. Some breathalyzers will have a slope detector to indicate the presence of mouth alcohol. However, this detector is not completely reliable, and often the machine will confuse mouth alcohol for breath alcohol. Most mouth alcohol will dissipate from a personâ€™s mouth in 15 minutes. Therefore, the observation period is legally required to ensure accurate results. To satisfy the requirement, the person does not need to be watched continuously. In Manriquez v. Gourley, 105 Cal. App. 4th 1227 (2003), continuous observation was satisfied when an officer could smell and hear the person burp, vomit, etc.', 'Chemical Tests', 0),

Although some breathalyzers have systems to distinguish mouth alcohol from breath alcohol (a slope detector), they are not completely reliable or accurate.
