These actions might introduce tiny amounts of alcohol in a person’s mouth, which might result in an inaccurate BAC reading because the machine assumes it is only measuring a person’s breath, and not any mouth alcohol. Any alcohol in a person’s mouth, even very tiny amount, can result in a higher and incorrect BAC measurement. Some breathalyzers will have a slope detector to indicate the presence of mouth alcohol. However, this detector is not completely reliable, and often the machine will confuse mouth alcohol for breath alcohol. Most mouth alcohol will dissipate from a person’s mouth in 15 minutes. Therefore, the observation period is legally required to ensure accurate results. To satisfy the requirement, the person does not need to be watched continuously. In Manriquez v. Gourley, 105 Cal. App. 4th 1227 (2003), continuous observation was satisfied when an officer could smell and hear the person burp, vomit, etc.', 'Chemical Tests', 0),

However, a tiny amount of alcohol in a person''s mouth will be picked up and result in an overly high BAC measurement. Although some breathalyzers have systems to distinguish mouth alcohol from breath alcohol (a slope detector), they are not completely reliable or accurate. Most mouth alcohol dissipates from a person''s mouth in 15 minutes.

For this reason, prosecutors will try to estimate the person’s BAC at the time of driving to prove a DUI. All too often, they will estimate a higher BAC at the time of driving than when a person took the chemical test, because they assume that your body was burning off alcohol between the time period of arrest and testing. This is called “retrograde extrapolation.” However, this assumption is clearly wrong if you had a drink shortly before being arrested and tested, because your body was still absorbing that drink.

However, this detector is not completely reliable, and often the machine will confuse mouth alcohol for breath alcohol. Most mouth alcohol will dissipate from a person’s mouth in 15 minutes. Therefore, the observation period is legally required to ensure accurate results. To satisfy the requirement, the person does not need to be watched continuously. In Manriquez v. Gourley, 105 Cal.
